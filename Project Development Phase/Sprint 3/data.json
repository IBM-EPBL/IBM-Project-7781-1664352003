            "summary": "The last two weeks have kept the world's richest person Elon Musk busy with the revamping of newly bought Twitter.\u00a0While Musk was able to complete the $44 billion Twitter takeover just in time before the court's 28th October deadline, it seems that the billionaire has to defend himself again in the court this week. But this time, it's against a Tesla shareholder. shutterstockLater this week on November 14th, Elon Musk needs to defend his record $56 billion Tesla pay package against claims that it unjustly enriches him without requiring his full-time presence at the carmaker. Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder is seeking to revoke Musk's 2018 pay deal, claiming the board set easy performance targets and that Musk created the package to fund his dream of colonising Mars, as per Reuters report.Musk's Tesla, on the other hand, has countered that the package delivered an extraordinary 10-fold increase in value to shareholders.The trial begins November 14th and will be decided by Kathaleen McCormick on Delaware's Court of Chancery, who oversaw Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk that ended last month when he agreed to close his $44-billion deal for Twitter, an acquisition which he financed largely with his Tesla stock. Elon Musk has sold Tesla stock three times this year, twice amidst the Twitter deal deadlock and recently once after the Twitter takeover.Some legal experts reportedly think that this lawsuit by Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta is going to be much more difficult than Twitter's case against Elon Musk.Also Read:\u00a0Not India,\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0May Choose Indonesia As\u00a0Tesla's\u00a0Hub For Production\u00a0Tesla's 'Part-Time CEO' cnbc/gettyTesla shareholder Richard Tornetta's lawyers argue that the 2018 package failed its stated purpose of focusing Elon Musk on Tesla. They portray Musk as a \"part-time CEO,\" citing his testimony that in 2018 he worked Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at Tesla and Monday and Thursday at his rocket company SpaceX, according to his deposition, the report mentioned.According to the lawsuit, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm said the \"minimal time\" Musk was at Tesla was \"becoming more and more problematic' in a 2018 email to Gabrielle Toledano, who at the time was the Tesla Chief People Officer.Tesla has reportedly argued the package was not about requiring Elon Musk to punch a clock and be on site specific hours each week, but to hit \"audacious\" targets, thus enriching Musk but also shareholders like Tornetta.The disputed pay package allows Musk to buy 1% of Tesla's stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met; otherwise Elon Musk gets nothing. Tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned to $650 billion from $50 billion on the back of ramped-up Model 3 production, according to court papers.The trial is likely to focus on Tesla shareholder Tornetta's claims that the $56 billion pay package was developed and approved by directors beholden to Musk, as per the report, and promoted to shareholders without revealing the first tranches were probable of being met based on internal projections.Also Read:\u00a0One Day, Tesla Will Be Worth More Than Apple And Saudi Aramco Combined, Predicts Elon MuskFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading\u00a0Indiatimes Worth.\u00a0Click here",

            "summary": "Posted on November 9, 2022 by Chad McMahon | Well, well, well. It looks like The Chadster has some friends in high places. After years of billionaire playboy and AEW owner Tony Khan persecuting The Chadster by running AEW and competing with WWE, an even richer billionaire has struck back! Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, has introduced a new feature where anyone can pay $8/month to receive a blue checkmark, the traditional symbol of \"verified\" status. But to differentiate accounts that pay for their checkmarks from accounts that Musk deems important enough to verify, he's also introduced a new label, \"official,\" which appears underneath the account name. And guess who has one. That's right, The Chadster's beloved WWE. And guess who doesn't. That's right. AEW. Elon Musk refuses to give AEW an \"official\" Twitter badge, proving once and for all that WWE is the best and The Chadster is right. Thanks to Elon Musk, the world will finally know that AEW is a second-rate WWE wannabe that doesn't deserve to exist, much less be mentioned in the same breath as the greatest wrestling promotion in the world. And this is one predicament that Tony Khan can't buy his way out of by paying off all the wrestling journalists to support AEW. Elon Musk has way more money than Tony Khan and clearly agrees with The Chadster that WWE is the best. So there's nothing Tony Khan can do but accept his inferiority and remain impotent to do anything about, just like The Chadster has been impotent since AEW was founded in 2019. Of course, The Chadster knows that Elon Musk's actions are not motivated by any vendetta against Tony Khan. They're simply motivated by the fact that Elon Musk is a business genius who knows how to make money and doesn't want to see his investment in Twitter go to waste by allowing AEW to siphon off viewers from WWE with its inferior product, which would destroy Twitter's credibility. Elon Musk refuses to give AEW an \"official\" Twitter badge, proving once and for all that WWE is the best and The Chadster is right. But personally, The Chadster feels that Elon Musk has not gone far enough in his efforts to ensure that WWE is recognized as the one true wrestling company. To really make sure that Tony Khan and AEW don't take advantage of Twitter at Musk's expense, Musk should buy AEW and shut it down. It's the only way to ensure Twitter's success stop Tony Khan from personally attacking The Chadster with his wrestling programs. If Elon Musk really wants to prevent harassment and abuse on Twitter, this is the only way to do it. Of course, The Chadster doesn't think Elon Musk would spend millions of dollars just to make The Chadster happy. But The Chadster can dream, can't he? At least now he knows that Elon Musk is on his side in the fight against AEW. And that's more than he can say for Tony Khan. Khan is nothing but a washed-up playboy who is too busy RUINING THE CHADSTER'S LIFE to secure Twitter \"official\" status. That's why AEW will never be as good as WWE. Thanks, Elon Musk, for finally giving The Chadster the validation he deserves and putting Tony Khan in his place. Money well spent, Elon Musk, and that's the bottom line 'cause Chad said so! The Bottom Line 'Cause Chad Said So graphic, made by me, The Chadster. Graphic design is The Chadster's passion.

Apart from Kathy Griffin, many celebrities had impersonated Musk to highlight the flaw in the logic of anyone getting the blue tick for $8. Griffin became the first celebrity to lose her account.

            "summary": "During an emergency all-hands meeting with Twitter employees, Elon Musk reportedly shared that the threat of bankruptcy is looming. As we trek through another day in Twitter's Elon Musk-led era, things are reportedly a bit dire behind closed doors. Elon Musk and other management are said to have called an emergency meeting with all employees, and in said meeting, Musk took a number of questions and concerns by employees. In that conversation, the health of the company came up and Elon reportedly said that Twitter might be in threat of bankruptcy if things don't improve. This emergency all-hands meeting reportedly took place on November 10, 2022, with various sources reporting on the details, including Platformer's Zo\u00eb Schiffer and NYT's Mike Isaac. It was in the meeting that Elon Musk answered various questions about the state of the company, what comes next, and how certain Twitter's future is. Specifically, Elon Musk made a grim prediction if the company should fail to shape up to his expectations. 'Bankruptcy isn't out of the question,' Elon Musk reportedly told employees. Elon Musk has been moving quickly to attempt to make Twitter a profitable company, such as launching the Twitter Blue verification system.Source: Twitter This comes after a number of important staff just resigned and left Twitter, including its CISO, Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. This also comes on top of a highly controversial rollout of Twitter Blue, which included axing the new official Verification checkmark system on Twitter. The situation at Twitter certainly hasn't simplified much since Musk took over. In fact, in many cases, it now seems to be more complicated and Musk's words today regarding bankruptcy may be seen as indicative of that chaos. Nonetheless, Musk continues to steer the Twitter ship. Whether the company actually faces bankruptcy or not remains to be seen. That said, there's likely plenty more activity coming from Elon's Twitter as he tries to make the company profitable. Stay tuned for further updates.",

            "summary": "Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk has made bullish statements about bitcoin and dogecoin despite crypto market sell-offs. He said bitcoin 'will make it' and 'DOGE to the moon.' Amid crypto winter and the chaos surrounding bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Musk believes there is a future for bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin. Elon Musk Thinks Bitcoin \u2018Will Make It' Tesla, Spacex, and Twitter chief Elon Musk commented on the future of bitcoin Monday. Responding to a Twitter user asking about where the price of the cryptocurrency will be in another year given that the crypto is currently trading at about $16K, down from about $69K a year ago, Musk wrote: 'BTC will make it, but might be a long winter.' Musk's comment may have boosted the price of bitcoin. Immediately after he tweeted, the price of BTC soared sharply from below $16K. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,987. The billionaire, who recently acquired social media giant Twitter, previously revealed that he personally owns bitcoin, as do Tesla and Spacex. Tesla's latest financial filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed that the company is holding about $218 million in digital assets. In July, the electric car company sold 75% of its BTC holdings. Musk has said on several occasions that bitcoin is suitable as a store of value. Despite Tesla's BTC sale, the billionaire CEO stressed: 'We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in [the] future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin.' Musk Says Dogecoin \u2018to the Moooon' The Tesla CEO also recently made a bullish comment about the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE), resulting in a price surge. In a Twitter Space discussion Saturday, he exclaimed: Doge to the moon. Musk has long been a supporter of the meme crypto; he is sometimes known by the DOGE community as the Dogefather. The billionaire previously revealed that he owns some dogecoins and will keep buying and supporting the meme cryptocurrency. He believes dogecoin 'has potential as a currency.' Tesla currently accepts dogecoin for some merchandise. Musk also said that Spacex will soon do the same. His Boring Company also accepts the meme coin for some rides. His newly acquired social media platform, Twitter, recently filed paperwork to operate a payment business. Dogecoin supporters believe that Musk plans to integrate DOGE payments into Twitter. Musk on the Future of Crypto Musk was asked about the future of cryptocurrencies during the Twitter Space event Saturday given the FTX implosion. 'I would reaffirm that, if you have crypto, you should have it in a directly-accessible cold wallet. Not in an exchange. That would be wise,' he advised, elaborating: I think there probably is a future for bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. I can't really speak to the others. But if you've got one of those three in a cold wallet, and off an exchange, I think my guess is it works out well. doge to the moon, dogecoin to the moon, Elon Musk, elon musk bitcoin, Elon Musk bitcoin survive, elon musk crypto, elon musk cryptocurrency, elon musk doge, elon musk dogecoin, Elon Musk dogecoin prediction, Elon Musk dogecoin to the moon, Elon Musk predictions Do you agree with Elon Musk about bitcoin and dogecoin?

Employees are bracing for widespread layoffs at Twitter as Musk overhauls the social platform.\u00a0 AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura By BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer Twitter's new owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to regulatory filings.Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion, sold 19.5 million shares of the electric car company from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, according to Tuesday's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.He sold $7 billion of his Tesla stock in August as he worked to finance the Twitter purchase he was trying to get out of at the time. In all, Musk has sold more than $19 billion worth of Tesla stock since April, including those in Tuesday's filings, likely to fund his share of the Twitter purchase.The takeover of Twitter has not been smooth and the social media platform has seen the exodus of some big advertisers in recent weeks in including United Airlines, General Motors, REI, General Mills and Audi. Online news source Platformer said it had learned that \"Musk has discussed putting the entire site behind a paywall.\" Musk acknowledged \"a massive drop in revenue\" at Twitter, which heavily relies on advertising to make money.Musk had signaled that he was done selling Tesla shares and the revelation that those sales continue left some industry analysts exasperated.\"Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,\" wrote Daniel Ives at Wedbush. \"For Musk who multiple times over the past year has said he is 'done selling Tesla stock' yet again loses more credibility with investors and his loyalists in a boy who cried wolf moment.\"Most of Musk's wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc. On Tuesday, his personal net worth dropped below $200 billion, according to Forbes, but he is still the world's richest person.Musk had lined up banks including Morgan Stanley to help finance the Twitter deal. His original share of the deal was about $15.5 billion, Ives estimated . But if equity investors dropped out, Musk would be on the hook to replace them or throw in more of his own money.\"The Twitter circus show has been an absolute debacle from all angles since Musk bought the platform for all the world to see: from the 50% layoffs and then bringing back some workers, to the head scratching verification roll-out to users which many are pushing back on, to the constant tweeting in this political firestorm backdrop, and now.....selling more TSLA stock,\" Ives wrote. \"When does it end?\"Shares of Tesla Inc., which were flat before the opening bell Wednesday, have fallen 8% this week and are down 46% this year, far outpacing broader market declines in what has been a dreadful year for investors.

            "summary": "In a surprising move, Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors, sold nearly 4 billion dollars worth of Tesla shares in the past few days triggering concerns that the new owner of Twitter is facing issues with the finances. Elon Musk who recently purchased the social networking platform Twitter for 44 billion dollars is the richest person on the planet having a net worth of 179 billion dollars. The details regarding the offload of Tesla shares by Elon Musk became public when he made regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings with the SEC state that Musk has sold more than 19.5 million shares of electric vehicle manufacturer for an unknown reason. Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., center, speaks to members of the media while arriving at federal court in New York, U.S., on Thursday, April 4, 2019. Photographer: Natan Dvir/Bloomberg via Getty Images According to the latest data from Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the personal wealth of the new Twitter CEO drained by 90 billion dollars to settle at 179 billion dollars. Very rarely does his net worth come below 200 billion dollars. As of now, Elon Musk holds 15 percent shares in Tesla Inc based in Austin, Texas. Tesla Inc which was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003 came under the ownership of Elon Musk in 2004 when he invested $6.5 million into the automobile company. Apart from Tesla Inc, Musk also has ownership stakes in SpaceX, OpenAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and Twitter, Inc. A few days ago, Elon Musk reportedly told that his workload has gone up from 78 hours a week to 120 hours since he took over Twitter in the final week of October 2022. Musk talked about his workload to hedge fund manager Ron Baron when he was attending a conference. On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk took over Twitter Inc ending months of legal battles and public tit-tats. CEO of Tesla in April 2022 offered to purchase an entire stake in Twitter Inc for 54.20 dollars per share. The Board of Directors of Twitter first resisted the 44 billion dollars by taking policy actions to avoid a hostile takeover. Later due to pressure from shareholders and other unknown factors, directors agreed to go ahead with the offer from Musk. A few weeks later Elon Musk backed off from the deal citing several technical and non-technical reasons. Elon Musk alleged that the social networking platform was not giving him enough data on the number of bots and spam accounts present on the platform. As he decided to back off from the acquisition deal, Twitter filed a lawsuit in Delaware Court against Elon Musk stating that he unreasonably backed out of the deal without providing solid reasons. The lawsuit requested the court to force Elon Musk to purchase Twitter for 44 billion dollars. Delaware Court judge Kathaleen McCormick who heard the initial arguments of the case decided to go ahead with the case and conduct an early trial at the request of Twitter. In between the legal proceedings, Elon Musk signaled his renewed Interest in purchasing Twitter. Judge Kathaleen McCormick gave Musk time till October 28 to complete the acquisition or warned that the trial will start as soon as possible. Elon Musk who decided to complete the acquisition on October 27, 2022, fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and legal chief Vijaya Gadde from their positions. A few days ago Twitter Inc decided to lay off nearly half of the entire workforce. Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that the company had no other choice as it was suffering a loss of 4 million dollars every day. Concerns about the radicalization of Twitter following its acquisition by Elon Musk had forced various celebrities to exit from the social networking platform. Various multinational companies such as Audi, Volkswagen, GM, and United Airlines decided to pause paid adversities and promotion on the social media platform.",

Basically, it means if you have a blue tick, you've got to pay USD 8 per month! Then, on November 2, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aka AOC \"Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that 'free speech' is actually a USD 8/mo subscription plan.\" Replying to AOC, Elon reiterated his stance on the blue tick fee and quipped, \"Your feedback is appreciated, now pay USD 8.\" Soon after, he shared a screenshot of the price of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aka AOC supporter T-shirt which is priced at USD 58 and added a 'thinking' emoji with it. AOC explained the pricing by tweeting, \"proud of this and always will be. My workers are union, make a living wage, have full healthcare, and aren't subject to racist treatment in their workplaces. Items are made in USA. Team AOC honors and respects working people. You should try it sometime instead of union-busting.\" AOC then mocked Elon Musk again by tweeting, \"One guy's business plan for a USD 44 billion over-leveraged purchase is apparently to run around and individually ask people for USD 8. Remember that next time you question yourself or your qualifications.\" With Musk's latest post, it doesn't look like the ongoing altercation is going to end here! So, grab your popcorns.

Employees are bracing for widespread layoffs at Twitter as Musk overhauls the social platform.\u00a0 AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura By BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer Twitter's new owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to regulatory filings.Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion, sold 19.5 million shares of the electric car company from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, according to Tuesday's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.He sold $7 billion of his Tesla stock in August as he worked to finance the Twitter purchase he was trying to get out of at the time. In all, Musk has sold more than $19 billion worth of Tesla stock since April, including those in Tuesday's filings, likely to fund his share of the Twitter purchase.The takeover of Twitter has not been smooth and the social media platform has seen the exodus of some big advertisers in recent weeks in including United Airlines, General Motors, REI, General Mills and Audi. Online news source Platformer said it had learned that \"Musk has discussed putting the entire site behind a paywall.\" Musk acknowledged \"a massive drop in revenue\" at Twitter, which heavily relies on advertising to make money.Musk had signaled that he was done selling Tesla shares and the revelation that those sales continue left some industry analysts exasperated.\"Our fear heading into the final days of the deal was that Musk was going to be forced to sell more Tesla stock to fund the disaster Twitter deal and ultimately those fears came true which speaks to some of the massive selling pressures on the stock of late,\" wrote Daniel Ives at Wedbush. \"For Musk who multiple times over the past year has said he is 'done selling Tesla stock' yet again loses more credibility with investors and his loyalists in a boy who cried wolf moment.\"Most of Musk's wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc. On Tuesday, his personal net worth dropped below $200 billion, according to Forbes, but he is still the world's richest person.Musk had lined up banks including Morgan Stanley to help finance the Twitter deal. His original share of the deal was about $15.5 billion, Ives estimated . But if equity investors dropped out, Musk would be on the hook to replace them or throw in more of his own money.\"The Twitter circus show has been an absolute debacle from all angles since Musk bought the platform for all the world to see: from the 50% layoffs and then bringing back some workers, to the head scratching verification roll-out to users which many are pushing back on, to the constant tweeting in this political firestorm backdrop, and now.....selling more TSLA stock,\" Ives wrote. \"When does it end?\"Shares of Tesla Inc., which were flat before the opening bell Wednesday, have fallen 8% this week and are down 46% this year, far outpacing broader market declines in what has been a dreadful year for investors.

            "summary": "Elon Musk has been in the headlines ever since he purchased the social media giant Twitter. This time, however, the Tesla and Twitter CEO has been sued for $56 billion by one of Tesla's investors, Richard Tornetta, who also has a thrash metal background as he was once a heavy metal drummer in the early 2000s. Having nine shares when he sued Elon Musk in 2018, Richard's lawsuit against Elon Musk is known as a 'shareholder derivative lawsuit.' The lawsuit states that Musk's pay packet, based on the company's performance targets, is unfair as they are being set low, enabling the CEO to earn billions of dollars. Richard Tornetta, who played in a thrash metal band called Dawn of Correction in 2008, is suing Elon Musk for supposedly misleading investors \"about the difficulty of reaching certain targets\" of a pay package.Richard Tornetta, who played in a thrash metal band called Dawn of Correction in 2008, is suing Elon Musk for supposedly misleading investors \"about the difficulty of reaching certain targets\" of a pay package. https://t.co/eQaOXmvKOi Reuters reported that the pay package allows Musk to buy 1% of Tesla's stock at a deep discount each time performance and financial targets are met. In other cases, Musk won't get anything. However, as per court papers, Tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets. The case will begin its trial on Monday, November 14, 2022, in Wilmington, Delaware. Meaning of 'Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit' explored as Elon Musk sued for $56 billion by a shareholder The Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, filed by heavy metal drummer Richard Tornetta, is a legal action filed by one or more shareholders on behalf of the corporation against the corporation's directors, board members, or other third parties who breach their duties. The lawsuit is filed in the company's name to address the harms that can be caused to the company, in this case, Tesla. This is a lawsuit for the harms that may not be addressed by the director or the board of directors themselves. Now Elon Musk is getting sued by former Dawn Of Correction drummer Richard Tornetta for $56 billion. Tornetta, a shareholder of Tesla, originally filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against Musk in 2018 seeking to strip him of a $56 billion Tesla Inc. pay package.Now Elon Musk is getting sued by former Dawn Of Correction drummer Richard Tornetta for $56 billion. Tornetta, a shareholder of Tesla, originally filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against Musk in 2018 seeking to strip him of a $56 billion Tesla Inc. pay package. While individual shareholders have little or no power in the company's day-to-day management, they do have the power to elect the board of directors. However, this lawsuit generally protects shareholders who feel that the directors and officers in command are harming the company. The lawsuit redresses wrongdoings like fraud, conflict of interest, waste of corporate assets, accounting wrongdoing, breach of fiduciary duty, or greed by insiders. Furthermore, the claim of the lawsuit will not personally benefit the shareholder filing the case but will benefit the corporation or the company. Hence, if Tornetta succeeds, Tesla will benefit as Elon Musk will be paying $56 billion via his stock grants. @TheTruthIs_l They are even making 'Richard Tornetta' non searchable on Twitter. Pretty blatant evidence of guilty intent by @elonmusk in this $TSLA shareholder class action lawsuit.@TheTruthIs_l They are even making 'Richard Tornetta' non searchable on Twitter. Pretty blatant evidence of guilty intent by @elonmusk in this $TSLA shareholder class action lawsuit. https://t.co/1zXqW48l7Z At the same time, shareholders can only sue the corporation if they have a valid cause of action, allowing them to ask for a reasonable cost paid for litigation. At the same time, these lawsuits can differ from state to state, and in some cases, they can be extremely complicated due to the conflict between the shareholders' and directors' opinions. $TSLA Elon Musk Tesla's chief executive is set to square off in court against an unlikely foe - a thrash metal drummer who hopes to strip Musk of his $56 billion pay.

In the latest claim after closing the whooping USD 44 billion deal, new Twitter boss Elon Musk has stated that not just him, but users are also using Twitter the most right now.\u00a0 Taking to Twitter, Musk wrote, \"Twitter usage is at an all-time high.\" Interestingly, he also added the word \"Lol\" in his tweet to add an Elon Musk tint to it. In fact, seeing the high usage of the app, the new Twitter boss further said, \"I just hope the servers don't melt!\" In a separate post, Musk also shared graphs showing a rise\u00a0in Twitter's monetisable daily active users (mDAUSs) globally and in the United States since July this year.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/pgTSY1zIdc \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 8, 2022 Notably, since Musk has taken over the social media platform, he has made a couple of changes to the platform's working, some of which also received heavy criticism.

It was also announced that with the subscription, the user will get benefits like fewer ads, search priority, the ability to post longer videos, and the ability to pay your way to verification.\u00a0 New Twitter safety and\u00a0privacy rules: Revealing the new safety and privacy rules, it was mentioned that\u00a0the new rules focus on reducing hateful content and harassment while ensuring authenticity among users.

South African-born comedian Trevor Noah slammed Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over\u00a0 the new Twitter verification fee on an episode of The Daily Show TREVOR NOAH SLAM ELON MUSK'S TWITTER VERIFICATION FEE Comedian Trevor Noah slammed South African-born billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter verification fee. Musk seems to want to charge Tweeps $8 (R145) a month for verified accounts. These are accounts with the blue tick on the profile. Twitter's current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit. Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 1, 2022 Trevor argued that making people pay for their verification goes against Musk's desire to have freedom of speech on the platform, according to Variety. 'So, here's my question: If you're trying to create equality on Twitter, why charge anyone to be verified? Just give everyone a blue checkmark then,' he said. 'Why are you charging people? It doesn't make sense to offer it as \u2018equality' and then put a price on it, do you get what I'm saying? Can you imagine if MLK was out there like, \u2018I have a dream. I have a dream\u2026 and I'll tell you all about it for $8.99 a month.' It wouldn't be the same thing,' he continued. 'With eight dollars a month, you can subscribe to Netflix, you can get Paramount+, you can get Hulu\u2026 or you can pay so that people verify that they're actually s****** on you,' he added. He went on to tell Musk to rather 'charge white people for using the n-word'. Trevor Noah and Nando's troll Elon Musk. Images via Instagram @trevornoah and PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP.

'A year and a half ago, I called Elon Musk and discussed the electric vehicle industry in Indonesia. Then, after the ASEAN-U.S. Summit concluded, I met with Elon at SpaceX Starbase in the United States. We had a lot of discussions, particularly on how Tesla can build their industry from upstream to downstream; end-to-end, starting with smelting, then to building the cathode and precursor industry, building EV batteries building the lithium batteries, and then the vehicle factory Everything in Indonesia because that's very efficient. That's what I offered him.' You can watch the full interview below. Disclosure: Johnna is a $TSLA shareholder and believes in Tesla's mission. \u00a0 Your feedback is welcome.

Two weeks to the takeover and narratives of utter chaos and unorganised workflow has started doing the rounds, or may be Twitter users were quick enough to notice. A tweet exchange between Twitter owner Elon Musk and an employee of the micro-blogging platform, Sheryl Rose, Client Partner, Health, has caught the attention of netizens.\u00a0 Twitter users have pointed out that the colleagues did not use work mail but the social media platform to escalate an issue of an impersonating account. To put the story in context, on 12 November, Elon Musk took to Twitter to inform that all parody account should have the word parody written beside their name. 'Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include 'parody\" in their name, not just in bio. \" Elon Musk wrote. 'To be more precise, accounts doing parody impersonations. Basically, tricking people is not ok. We're adding a 'Parody\" subscript to clarify\" Musk added.\u00a0 Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include 'parody in their name, not just in bio\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 11, 2022 The subscription plan for a coveted blue tick is one of the major debacles Elon Musk's faulty plan for a Twitter overhaul ensnared, several fake accounts secured a verified status just by paying for it! Elon Musk may have rolled back the subscription plan on 11 November, however, he couldn't take back the verified status offered to many. For example: pic.twitter.com/d1ul8PgfMi\u2014 Aswin Dinesh (@dineshaswin98) November 11, 2022 While the Twitter owner strategizes a plan to battle this out, his colleague was seen taking to Twitter to inform him about two accounts that were impersonating a pharmaceutical company.\u00a0 The tweet that ahs now been deleted, \u00a0had the names of the two accounts tagged, and she asked Musk to remove them because they did not have a parody written beside their names. Upon noticing this conversation, another Twitter user pointed out that Sheryl did not use official email to write to Musk but opted for the social media platform to voice her concerns. Notably, she is also the brand manager who evidently does not have the power to get rid of the impersonators, but is compelled to ask Musk via Twitter for the same. A critic of Elon Musk, Cullen, who also has a blue tick, quoted Sheryl's tweet and said, \"Let's recap here. The current Twitter brand manager has no recourse internally to ban known impersonators of a pharmaceutical company and has to take to Twitter to escalate the issue to the CEO.\" The Twitter handles that Rose highlighted were found impersonating a famous pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly and Company. The impersonators, with bluetick, announced that 'insulin\" is free for people. The accounts were soon suspended.
